# e-commerce-store-backend

## Description

In this project I created the backend for this e-commerce store using mySQL to create database table models and the restful API routes. The dotenv package was also used to protect sensitive information such as the username and password for the database.

## Installation

npm install

## Getting Started

- Create the database in mySQL Workbench using the db/schema.sql file
- Create a .env file using the .env.EXAMPLE to allow connection to the database
- Seed the database with test data running the `npm run seed` script
- Run `npm run start` to start the server

## Scripts

```
npm run seed
npm run start
npm run watch
```
